      <!-- Key Features:

            1.	aria-label="Breadcrumb":
            •	Provides an accessible label for assistive technologies (like screen readers), letting users know that this navigation represents a breadcrumb trail.
            2.	Structure:
            •	The breadcrumb trail is typically an unordered list (<ul>) where each item (<li>) contains a link (<a>). Each link moves higher or lower in the site hierarchy, from more general to more specific pages.
            3.	Functionality:
            •	Clicking on “Home” takes the user to the root of the website.
            •	Clicking on “Section” takes the user to a specific section within the website.
            •	The last item, in this case “Page,” represents the current page the user is on.

          Why Use Breadcrumbs:

            •	Usability: Helps users navigate back to parent sections with ease.
            •	SEO: Search engines like Google often use breadcrumbs to better understand the structure of a site, potentially improving search rankings.
            •	Efficiency: Users can quickly move to higher-level pages without needing to click the back button multiple times.

      content. • The main content area where the primary focus of the page is
      displayed, such as articles, forms, or other interactive content. -->

      <!-- To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element
          on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI),
          and accepts preset values. 
          Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One 
          method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the 
          aria-labelledby attribute. The aria-labelledby attribute must reference an id that already exists in your HTML.
          Example code:-->
            
      <section role="region" aria-labelledby="student-info" class="sections">  
        <h2 id="section-title">Section Title</h2>
              <div aria-labelledby="section-title">
                This is the content of the section that is described by the heading.
              </div>
       
        
        <!-- SECTION (structure): The “room dividers” inside the main content. • Organizes content into
        distinct sections with related information. For example, on a blog page,
        you could have different sections for the blog post, related articles,
        and comments.
        Purpose: Used to group related content thematically. A section typically 
          contains a heading and represents a standalone portion of content that is 
          thematically related.
          •	Usage: Use a section when you want to create distinct parts of the 
            content that share a common theme or subject matter.
          •	Example: In a blog post, you might have a section for the introduction,
            another for the main content, and a third for the conclusion.

            Use section,article and p for organizing textual content 
              with meaning and context, much like paragraphs in an essay. -->

        <!-- 	The best-practices for form inputs is give each input an appropriate type and name attribute
                1.	Text-based inputs:
                  •	text: For plain text input (default type).
                  •	password: Masks the input (used for passwords).
                  •	email: For email addresses (validates format).
                  •	tel: For telephone numbers.
                  •	url: For URLs (validates format).
                  •	search: For search fields (styled for search boxes in some browsers).
                2.	Number-based inputs:
                  •	number: For numerical values (allows up/down arrows to adjust).
                  •	range: A slider to select a number within a range.
                3.	Date/Time inputs:
                  •	date: For date input (pops up a date picker).
                  •	time: For time input.
                  •	datetime-local: For both date and time without time zone.
                  •	month: For selecting a month and year.
                  •	week: For selecting a week and year.
                4.	Choice-based inputs:
                  •	checkbox: For binary choices (yes/no, true/false).
                  •	radio: For selecting one option from a group.
                  •	select: Dropdown menu (though not an input per se, but used for multiple choices).
                5.	File and media inputs:
                  •	file: For file uploads.
                  •	image: Lets users submit an image file.
                6.	Others:
                  •	submit: Submits the form.
                  •	reset: Resets the form to default values.
                  •	button: A general button (doesn’t submit form by default).
                  •	color: For color input (shows a color picker).
                  •	hidden: Hidden field; not visible to the user but included in the form submission.

      <article class="articles">
        ARTICLE (structure): A “self-contained room” or “apartment” for individual content items. •
        Used for standalone content, like blog posts, news articles, or
        user-submitted content.
        Purpose: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could stand alone, 
        such as a blog post, news article, or user-submitted content. It usually includes
         its own title and is meant to be distributable or syndicateable.
        •	Usage: Use an article when the content is independently meaningful and could
           be published on its own, or when it makes sense to reference it outside of the 
           surrounding context.
        •	Example: Each blog post on a blog page can be wrapped in an article. 
        <!-- The <article> element is used to semantically group each coffee 
                    and price pair as standalone content. This improves accessibility

        <!-- Normally, whitespace between <p> tags is ignored. 
                    However, using display: inline-block causes the whitespace to be rendered, 
                    resulting in gaps between the elements. Placing elements on the same line 
                    removes this extra space. -->
      </article>
      <aside>
        <!-- • Aside: The “sidebar” or “storage room” for secondary information. •
        Holds supplementary content related to the main content but not part of
        it, such as ads, additional links, or author bio information. -->
      </aside>
      <div>
        <!-- DIV (structure): 
        • The “generic room” or “flex space.” • A versatile container that is
        used to group other elements together, often for layout purposes or

        structure.
        Purpose: A generic container used for grouping elements without any semantic 
        meaning. It's primarily used for styling and layout purposes.
      •	Usage: Use a div when there is no suitable semantic element to represent the content.
        It's helpful for applying CSS styles or JavaScript functionality but does not provide 
        meaning to the content itself.
      •	Example: Wrapping multiple sections together for styling or organizational purposes.
      Use div for grouping visual components or layout elements that don't have specific semantic 
        meaning, much like organizing different parts of a drawing or design. -->

     Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser 
     to know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, 
     the browser will default to text.

     The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to 
     submit its nearest parent form element. To handle the form submission, 
     after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute 
     set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit.
     
     minlength=8 sets the minimum length of a password to 8 chars

          <!-- FIELDSET (structure) :

        You typically use a  fieldset instead of a section when you are grouping related form elements. 
        The fieldset element is specifically designed for forms to group inputs, making it clear that 
        they belong to a particular section of the form. It also allows you to optionally use a 
        legend element to label the group.

          Here's a comparison:
          
          When to Use fieldset
          
            •	Group related form elements together (e.g., personal details, payment information).
            •	Provide a visual boundary around the group of form inputs.
            •	Use legend to give a label for the group.
        When to Use section

          •	section is used for grouping content that is thematically related on the page, 
          but not specifically for forms.
          •	It organizes large sections of the page, not just form elements.
        

          •	fieldset: Specifically for forms, helps group related inputs with an optional label (legend).
            •	section: Used for broader page content, more general for organizing non-form content. -->
          <!-- The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together 
          in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning 
            that they appear on a new line. -->

          <!-- The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. 
            It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.-->

                be sent to the server when the form is submitted if that radio 
                button is selected. By assigning a value to each radio button, 
                the form will send meaningful data (rather than just "on") associated

          <!-- To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the

          was shipped in. Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used
          to control the space between other boxes or elements. Here the bottom

<!-- A screen reader is a type of assistive technology that helps people with visual impairments or blindness use 
 computers and other digital devices. It reads the content of the screen aloud using speech synthesis, allowing users
  to navigate and interact with the device through auditory feedback.

Here’s how it works:

	•	Reading text: Screen readers interpret and read text on the screen, including web pages, documents, and emails,
     aloud.
	•	Navigating: Users can move around the screen using keyboard commands instead of a mouse. The screen reader 
    announces elements like buttons, menus, links, and forms.
	•	Describing elements: It also provides information about non-text elements such as images, tables, or headings. 
    If an image has alt text, the screen reader will read that description.
	•	Special modes for web pages: Screen readers have special modes to help navigate websites, often moving from 
    heading to heading, link to link, or other structural elements, making web browsing more efficient.

Popular screen readers include:

	•	JAWS (Job Access With Speech): One of the most well-known screen readers for Windows.
	•	NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access): A free, open-source screen reader for Windows.
	•	VoiceOver: Apple’s built-in screen reader for macOS and iOS devices.
	•	TalkBack: Google’s screen reader for Android devices.
