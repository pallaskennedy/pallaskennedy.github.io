Table Tags
  <table>: Defines the overall table structure.
  <tr>: Represents a table row.
  <th>: Table header. Content inside <th> is typically bold and centered by default.
  <td>: Table data. Regular content cell within a row.

  Other useful table attributes:
    colspan: Spans multiple columns.
    rowspan: Spans multiple rows.
    border: Adds a border to the table.
    caption: Adds a caption above the table to describe it.

Text and Structure Tags
  <h1> - <h6>: Headings from most important (<h1>) to least important (<h6>). These help structure 
    the page and are important for SEO.
  <p>: Paragraph. Represents a block of text with automatic margins.
  <br>: Line break. Creates a line break within content (use sparingly, as it’s better to use block 
    elements like <p>).
  <hr>: Horizontal rule. Typically used to separate sections with a horizontal line.

Container Tags
  <div>: A block-level container used to group content. Commonly used for layout purposes (e.g., in 
      CSS Grid or Flexbox) or applying styles to groups of elements.
  <span>: Inline container, commonly used for styling small portions of text or inline elements without 
    disrupting the flow of content.

List Tags
  <ul>: Unordered list. A list of items with bullet points.
  <ol>: Ordered list. A list of items with numbers or letters.
  <li>: List item. Represents an individual item within a list, used inside <ul> or <ol>.

Notes on Structure:
  Nesting: Tags like <ul> and <ol> must contain <li> elements. Similarly, <table> must contain <tr>, 
    and <tr> must contain <td> or <th>.
  Semantic HTML: Consider using semantic tags for better structure, such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, 
    <section>, <aside>, etc., which improve accessibility and SEO.
  Accessibility: Use proper heading order for content structure (i.e., don’t skip <h2> after <h1>, etc.). 
    It helps screen readers and users with disabilities.

“Analyze markup to structure content and organize data”

1. Identify the correct use case for each tag to help organize and structure the content of a webpage. 

2. Evaluate whether tags are correctly nested. 

3. Select and use the correct HTML tags for specific content structure. F

4. Analyze if the structure is accessible, such as:
  Using proper headings to create a logical structure.
  Ensuring that content is appropriately grouped using semantic tags.
  Using <alt> attributes for images and other accessibility features.

5. When working with tables, you should be able to check if data is being represented clearly and logically:
  Use <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> for organizing table sections.
  Ensure that table headers are appropriately applied with <th>.
  Validate the use of colspan and rowspan attributes for merging cells.

6. nalyze whether unordered (<ul>) or ordered (<ol>) lists are being used correctly and that
   list items are properly wrapped in <li> tags.

7. Assess whether elements like <div> or <span> are used inappropriately where semantic HTML (like <article>, 
  <section>, etc.) would be more suitable. Ensure the markup uses structural tags that enhance readability 
    and accessibility for users and search engines.
