<!-- ## 4. Multimedia Presentation using HTML
### 4.1 Construct and analyze markup that displays images
- `img` and `picture` elements and their attributes-->

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- IMAGES  -->
<img
  src="image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width="300"
  height="200"
  loading="lazy"
/>
<img
  src="image-small.jpg"
  srcset="image-large.jpg 1024w, image-medium.jpg 640w, image-small.jpg 320w"
  sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, (min-width: 640px) 640px, 320px"
  alt="Responsive Image"
/>
<!-- <img> primary way; empty (self-closing) tag -->
<!-- src (source): Specifies the relative path or an absolute URL -->
<!-- 	alt (alternative text): descriptive text if the image fails to load, used by screen readers 
        for accessibility, and for SEO; best practice to include -->
<!-- width and height: in pixels or percentages; prevents layout shifts during loading. -->
<!-- loading: control loading behavior (lazy loading).
	•	lazy: Defers loading the image until it’s near the viewport (improves page load speed).
	•	eager: Loads the image immediately. -->
<!-- srcset and sizes Attributes (for responsive images):
	•	srcset: Provides multiple image options based on screen size or pixel density. 
	•	sizes: Defines the display size of the image in different conditions -->

<picture>
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 800px)" />
  <source srcset="image-small.jpg" media="(max-width: 799px)" />
  <img src="fallback.jpg" alt="Fallback Image" />
</picture>
<!-- <picture> displays image based on the device or screen size, enabling responsive images.  -->
<!-- <source> Element:
	•	Defines multiple image sources for different conditions (like screen width or pixel density).
	•	srcset: Specifies the image file and size (or pixel density).
	•	media: Uses media queries to define when a particular source should be used (e.g., screen width or resolution). -->
<!-- <img> Element (Fallback/Default):
	•	Acts as a fallback if none of the <source> conditions are met or the browser doesn’t support <picture>. -->

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- When analyzing image markup, consider the following:
	1.	Accessibility:
	•	Is the alt attribute present and descriptive?
	•	Does the image contribute meaningfully to the content, or is it decorative? If it’s decorative, consider 
		setting alt="" to skip it for screen readers.
	2.	Responsiveness:
	•	Is the image optimized for different devices using the <picture> element or srcset/sizes attributes?
	•	Does the markup cater to high-density (retina) displays with higher resolution images?
	3.	Performance:
	•	Are images being lazy-loaded using loading="lazy"?
	•	Are large image files avoided, and are appropriate image formats (e.g., WebP) used for performance improvements?
	4.	SEO:
	•	Is the alt attribute descriptive and keyword-rich where relevant to improve search engine indexing? -->
