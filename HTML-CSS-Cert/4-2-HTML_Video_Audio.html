<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<video controls autoplay muted loop poster="thumbnail.jpg" width="600">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="video.ogv" type="video/ogg" />

  <!-- Track for subtitles (English) -->
  <track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles.vtt" srclang="en" label="English" />

  <!-- Fallback message if video tag is not supported -->
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<!-- In the above example, the browser will attempt to load the video in the order of the provided sources until
    it finds a format it supports. MP4 is typically the most widely compatible format across all browsers. -->

<!-- controls: Displays playback controls like play, pause, volume, etc. -->
<!-- autoplay: The video will start playing automatically when the page loads. -->
<!-- muted: The video will start without sound (this is often required when using autoplay due to browser policies). -->
<!-- loop: The video will start over automatically when it reaches the end. -->
<!-- poster: Displays the thumbnail.jpg image before the video starts playing or if the video cannot be loaded. -->
<!-- width: Sets the width of the video to 600 pixels. -->

<!-- Note: Autoplay and Muted: Most modern browsers, like Chrome, require that videos be muted when using 
    the autoplay attribute. This is why muted is commonly used in conjunction with autoplay. -->
<!-- Note: Poster: The poster image is displayed until the video starts playing or if the video fails to load. -->

<!-- <source> element is used to define multiple media sources for the <video> and <audio> elements. It allows 
    you to provide different formats or versions of the media to ensure compatibility across different browsers. -->

<!-- Common Video MIME Types:

	1.	MP4 (MPEG-4)
        MIME type: video/mp4
        File extension: .mp4
        Widely supported across all modern browsers.

	2.	WebM
        MIME type: video/webm
        File extension: .webm
        Supported in modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.

	3.	Ogg
        MIME type: video/ogg
        File extension: .ogv
        Older format, not as widely supported as MP4 or WebM, but works in Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.

	4.	AVI (Audio Video Interleave)
        MIME type: video/x-msvideo
        File extension: .avi
        Not natively supported in browsers but can be used with plugins or extensions.

	5.	MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)
        MIME type: video/mpeg
        File extension: .mpeg or .mpg
        Older format, not commonly used in modern web applications.

	6.	QuickTime (MOV)
        MIME type: video/quicktime
        File extension: .mov
        Developed by Apple; used with QuickTime player but not widely supported in browsers without plugins.

	7.	3GP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)
        MIME type: video/3gpp
        File extension: .3gp
        Primarily used for mobile devices.

	8.	FLV (Flash Video)
        MIME type: video/x-flv
        File extension: .flv
        Used by Adobe Flash Player (now deprecated and not supported by modern browsers).

<track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles.vtt" srclang="en" label="English" />
<!-- <track> allows you to provide subtitles, captions, or descriptions for your video, improving accessibility. -->
<!-- kind: Specifies the kind of track. Common values include subtitles (words only), captions (words and sounds), descriptions (sounds only) -->
<!-- src: The URL of the track file; usually a .vtt file for WebVTT format -->

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />

  <!-- Track for captions (English) -->
  <track kind="captions" src="captions.vtt" srclang="en" label="English" />

  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<!-- <track>: Defines the captions or other text tracks.
	•	kind="captions": Specifies that the track is for captions (you can also use kind="subtitles" if it’s more appropriate for your case).
	•	src="captions.vtt": The path to the WebVTT file that contains the caption text.
	•	srclang="en": Indicates the language of the captions (English in this case).
	•	label="English": The label for this track that will appear in the audio player’s track selection menu.
 
 	•	While the <track> element works well with <video> elements, support for it in <audio> elements is still limited in some browsers.
	•	Browsers that do support this feature will allow users to see captions or transcripts synchronized with the audio file.

<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
  width="560"
  height="315"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
<!-- <iframe> embed content from external sources -->
<!-- width and height: Set the size of the embedded content. -->
<!-- allowfullscreen: Allows the embedded video to be played in fullscreen mode. -->
<!-- src: The URL of the external content  -->
<!-- the src attribute in an <iframe> cannot use a relative path to access content stored in a local directory or 
        on your server unless that content is a web page or resource accessible through a web server.
	•	The src of an <iframe> must be a URL that can be accessed via HTTP or HTTPS. This can be either a full URL 
        or a relative URL pointing to content that is hosted on the same server as the web page.
	•	If you want to embed local content like an HTML file, you can use a relative path, but that content must be 
        served via a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or a local development server).
    •	Local files (like video files or PDFs stored locally on your computer) cannot be embedded using relative paths 
        unless the files are part of a website being served via a web server.
	•	Same-origin policy: Browsers enforce security rules that restrict how content from different domains (origins) 
        can interact. If the iframe content comes from a different domain, you might face issues with accessing or 
        interacting with it.

If you want to embed local media files, consider serving them through a local or remote web server and use a relative 
path or URL.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<!-- When analyzing multimedia elements, consider the following:
	•	Are multiple file formats provided (mp4, webm, ogg for video; mp3, ogg for audio) to ensure cross-browser support?
	•	Are <track> elements used for subtitles or captions to improve accessibility for users with hearing impairments?
	•	Are autoplaying videos muted to avoid disrupting the user experience?
	•	Is lazy-loading used for non-critical videos or audio to improve page load times?
	•	Are alt attributes or fallback content provided when embedding videos or audio to improve accessibility and SEO? -->
