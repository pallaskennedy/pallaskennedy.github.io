<!-- 3. Document Structure using HTML 
3.3 Construct and analyze markup that implements navigation 
    • target, anchor (a href), bookmark, relative vs. absolute links, navigating simple folder hierarchies, map, area 
 -->

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<!-- Anchor Tag (<a href="">)
	used to create hyperlinks, allowing navigation between pages or sections of a website -->
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

<!-- Relative Links
	Reference resources within the same website or directory.
	Used when linking to other pages or assets on the same site (e.g., HTML files, images, CSS). 
    More flexible; works within the same domain or folder structure.-->
<a href="about.html">About Us</a>

<!-- Absolute Links
	Reference a complete URL that includes the protocol and domain name.
	Used when linking to external websites or resources. 
    Directly links to external resources, independent of the current directory or site structure.-->
<a href="https://www.example.com">Go to Example</a>

<!-- Bookmark Links (Anchor Links):
	Used to create links to specific sections within the same webpage.
	Commonly used for internal navigation within a single page, linking to a specific part of 
    the page by referencing an id attribute of an element.
    When clicked, the browser scrolls to the element with the corresponding id.-->
<a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
...
<h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>

<!-- Navigating Folder Hierarchies:
    When working with multiple pages and directories, it’s important to know how to link between files 
    in different folders. -->
<a href="folder/about.html">RELATIVE: get to a page in a subfolder</a>
<a href="../contact.html"
  >RELATIVE: to link to a page in the parent directory</a
>
<a href="../images/gallery.html"
  >RELATIVE: To get to a page in an adjacent directory</a
>
<!-- Best Practices:
	•	Keep paths simple and organized.
	•	Use ../ to go up one level and avoid absolute paths for internal links, making it easier to move 
    the website structure.
 -->

<!-- <map> and <area> Tags for Image Mapping:
	Allow you to make different areas of an image clickable, each linking to a different location or resource.
        Attributes:
            shape: Defines the shape of the clickable area (rect, circle, poly).
            coords: Defines the coordinates of the area, varying based on the shape.
            alt: Provides alternative text for the area, important for accessibility.
            href: Specifies the link destination.-->
<img src="image.jpg" usemap="#image-map" />
<map name="image-map">
  <area
    shape="rect"
    coords="34,44,270,350"
    alt="Computer"
    href="computer.html"
  />
  <area shape="circle" coords="500,150,60" alt="Phone" href="phone.html" />
</map>

<!-- <nav>
    Use meaningful and descriptive link text for clarity and accessibility.
    The <nav> element should be used to wrap major navigation sections like menus or links that help users 
        navigate the website. -->

<!-- Accessibility Considerations:
	Use clear text for links that describes where they will take the user.
	Ensure that keyboard users can navigate through the links, and visually indicate which link is 
        currently selected.
	Target Attribute (target="_blank")opens the linked page in a new tab or window and is used when linking 
        to external resources, so users don’t navigate away from the current page. -->

<!-- “analyze markup that implements navigation,” 
    Check if links are properly implemented using the <a> tag and if the href attribute is correctly 
        pointing to either relative or absolute paths, internal sections (using bookmarks), or 
        external websites.
    Verify if navigation sections are wrapped with semantic elements like <nav>, which clearly define 
        navigation areas in the markup. 
    Analyze whether relative links (links within the same website) and absolute links (links to 
        external websites) are used correctly.
    Review if links are correctly referencing paths within folder structures. Ensure that the 
        paths are correct when navigating between pages in different directories or folders.
    If the page includes clickable image maps, analyze whether the <map> and <area> tags are implemented 
        properly. This would involve checking if the shapes, coordinates, and links are defined correctly.
    Review if the target="_blank" attribute is used where necessary, particularly when linking to external 
        sites, to ensure the user does not leave the current website unintentionally.
    Ensure that link text is descriptive and makes sense contextually, improving both accessibility and 
        SEO. For example, instead of generic phrases like “Click here,” use meaningful descriptions like 
        “Learn more about our services.”
    Ensure that the navigation markup is accessible. This might include:
        •	Using meaningful link text.
        •	Ensuring that navigation is keyboard-friendly (e.g., tabbing through links).
        •	Including aria-label or role="navigation" attributes to help screen readers.
        •	Providing visible focus indicators when links are clicked or tabbed through.
    Verify that the navigation structure is clear and consistent across the website, making it easy for 
        users to find their way around. This might involve checking:
        •	The use of <nav> for major navigation sections.
        •	Grouping related links within <ul>, <ol>, or <div> elements, with appropriate <li> tags for each 
            item. 
    Check if the navigation is responsive, ensuring that it works well on both desktop and mobile devices. 
    This may involve:
        •	Reviewing the use of a mobile-first approach with appropriate media queries.
        •	Ensuring the navigation is easily accessible on smaller screens (e.g., via a hamburger menu). 
    Ensure there are no broken links or incorrect paths that lead to “404 Not Found” errors.
    Test all links to confirm they navigate correctly and lead to the intended destinations.
