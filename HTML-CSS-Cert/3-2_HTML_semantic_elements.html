<!-- Semantic HTML5 Elements
What are they?
    Semantic elements are those that have a meaningful role in the page’s structure, both for content 
    organization and for improving accessibility. They describe their meaning in a clear, human- and 
    machine-readable way, which also helps search engines and other tools interpret the web page correctly.

Why Use Semantic HTML5 Elements?
    Accessibility: These elements help screen readers and assistive technologies understand the structure 
        and purpose of content more effectively.
    SEO: Search engines use semantic tags to better understand the context and relevance of the content.
    Code Organization: Using semantic tags makes it easier for developers to structure and maintain the
        content logically.
    Usability: Improves navigation and structure for users, especially when content is well-organized.

<!-- <header>
    Purpose: Represents the introductory content or a set of navigational links. Typically used for 
        logos, navigation links, or introductory text.
    Common Uses: At the top of the page or section. -->

<!-- <nav>
    Purpose: Defines a navigation block. Used for grouping a set of links related to navigation.
    Common Uses: Main menu or links for navigating different sections of a website. -->

<!-- <section>
    Purpose: Represents a section of content that’s related to a theme or a part of the document. Often
        contains a heading (<h1>, <h2>, etc.).
    Common Uses: Organizing content within the page, grouping thematically related elements. -->

<!-- <article>
    Purpose: Represents a self-contained, independent piece of content that could be distributed or reused
        on its own. It’s usually used for blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.
    Common Uses: Blog post, product description, or news article. -->

<!-- <aside>
    Purpose: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it (like a sidebar, pull 
        quotes, or advertisements).
    Common Uses: Sidebars, related links, and advertisements. -->

<!-- <footer>
    Purpose: Represents the footer section of a page or section, often containing information like contact 
        details, copyright information, or links.
    Common Uses: Page footers, section footers, or legal disclaimers. -->

<!-- <details> and <summary>
    Purpose: Used together to create a disclosure widget that users can open and close. 
        <details> contains the content
        <summary> is the visible heading for the expandable content.
    Common Uses: Frequently asked questions (FAQs), more details sections.

     -->

<!-- <figure> and <figcaption>
    Purpose: <figure> is used to represent content such as an image, diagram, or illustration. 
        <figcaption> is used to provide a caption for the content inside <figure>.
    Common Uses: Images with captions, illustrations, diagrams, and other media content. -->

“Analyze markup that uses HTML5 semantic elements” likely refers to evaluating how semantic HTML elements are
 used to structure and organize content. This involves assessing how these elements contribute to the overall
  structure, accessibility, and SEO of the web page.

Here’s what might be involved in this analysis:

1. Assessing Content Structure:
	•	Verify if semantic elements are used to organize content logically. 
	•	Analyze whether tags like <article> and <section> are used for content that can 
        stand alone (articles, blog posts, news) versus content that belongs within a larger context 
        (general content areas).

2. Accessibility Considerations:
	•	Check if semantic tags are helping screen readers interpret the content. Elements like <nav>, <main>, 
        and <header> allow screen readers to better understand and navigate the page.
	•	Ensure that the structure follows a logical flow for assistive technologies, with clear separation 
        between different content sections like <header>, <article>, and <footer>.

3. SEO Optimization:
	•	Determine if semantic elements are being used to enhance SEO. For example, <article> tells search 
        engines that the content is an independent piece, and <header> helps them identify the start of 
            important sections like the main navigation.
	•	Check that headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) are used correctly within semantic sections to define the 
        content’s hierarchy. A well-structured heading hierarchy helps both search engines and users 
        understand the page’s content.

4. Code Readability and Maintainability:
	•	Analyze whether the use of semantic elements makes the code easier to read and understand for
        developers. Using semantic HTML elements reduces the need for excessive div and span tags and
        makes the code more intuitive.
	•	Check if the use of semantic tags allows for a clearer separation between content (HTML) and 
        layout (CSS). For example, a <section> should contain content with a theme, while the layout 
            and presentation should be handled by CSS.

5. Mobile Responsiveness:
	•	Ensure that semantic elements are used in a way that supports responsive design. For instance, 
        a <nav> might contain a mobile-friendly hamburger menu, or a <section> might be designed to adapt 
            to different screen sizes.

6. Tag Redundancy and Overuse:
	•	Ensure semantic tags aren’t being overused where unnecessary. For example, it’s not required to wrap 
        everything in a <section>. Overuse can complicate the markup and lead to confusion.

Key Analysis Points to Look For:
	•	Are semantic tags used appropriately for the content they contain?
	•	Is the page structured logically and clearly, both for users and machines (like search engines or 
        screen readers)?
	•	Are headings used in a clear and hierarchical way?
	•	Is the code more readable and maintainable due to the use of semantic tags?
	•	Does the structure enhance SEO and accessibility?
