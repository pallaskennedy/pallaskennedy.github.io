<!-- A screen reader is a type of assistive technology that helps people with visual impairments or blindness use 
 computers and other digital devices. It reads the content of the screen aloud using speech synthesis, allowing users
  to navigate and interact with the device through auditory feedback.

Here’s how it works:

	•	Reading text: Screen readers interpret and read text on the screen, including web pages, documents, and emails,
     aloud.
	•	Navigating: Users can move around the screen using keyboard commands instead of a mouse. The screen reader 
    announces elements like buttons, menus, links, and forms.
	•	Describing elements: It also provides information about non-text elements such as images, tables, or headings. 
    If an image has alt text, the screen reader will read that description.
	•	Special modes for web pages: Screen readers have special modes to help navigate websites, often moving from 
    heading to heading, link to link, or other structural elements, making web browsing more efficient.

Popular screen readers include:

	•	JAWS (Job Access With Speech): One of the most well-known screen readers for Windows.
	•	NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access): A free, open-source screen reader for Windows.
	•	VoiceOver: Apple’s built-in screen reader for macOS and iOS devices.
	•	TalkBack: Google’s screen reader for Android devices.
