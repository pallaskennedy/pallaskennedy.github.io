            •	index: Tells search engines like Google that they should include this page in their search results. 
                If someone searches for a topic relevant to your page, it might appear in the search engine’s results.
            •	noindex: Tells search engines not to include this page in their search results. The page still exists, 
                but search engines won’t show it to users. You might use this if you don’t want certain pages, like a 
                login page, to appear in search results.
            •	follow:Tells search engines that they should crawl and explore all the links on this page. This means 
                the search engine will visit the other pages that these links point to and might include those linked 
                pages in search results. It’s the default behavior for most pages.
            •	nofollow: Tells search engines not to crawl or explore the links on this page. Even though users can still
                click the links, the search engines won’t give those links any ranking power (SEO value). This is often 
                used on pages with paid links or comments sections to prevent search engines from associating your site 
                with potentially harmful or irrelevant content.

  <body>
    <header>
      This section is like the room where you introduce people to the house (the
      site), possibly with a welcome mat, logo, or some initial information.
    </header>
    <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
      This is like the hallway or the set of doorways that let people move
      around the house (the website). If it's convenient, the navigation can be
      inside the header room, but it could also have its own space. ARIA
      landmarks or descriptive labels (like aria-label or aria-labelledby) can
      improve accessibility for screen readers.
    </nav>
    <nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/section">Section</a></li>
        <li><a href="/section/page">Page</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <main>
      • The “living room” of the page, which contains the most important
      content. • The main content area where the primary focus of the page is
      displayed, such as articles, forms, or other interactive content.

      <section>
        • The “room dividers” inside the main content. • Organizes content into
        distinct sections with related information. For example, on a blog page,
        you could have different sections for the blog post, related articles,
        and comments.
        Purpose: Used to group related content thematically. A <section> typically 
          contains a heading and represents a standalone portion of content that is 
          thematically related.
          •	Usage: Use a <section> when you want to create distinct parts of the 
            content that share a common theme or subject matter.
          •	Example: In a blog post, you might have a <section> for the introduction,
            another for the main content, and a third for the conclusion.

            Use <section>, <article></article>and <p> for organizing textual content 
              with meaning and context, much like paragraphs in an essay.
      </section>
      <article>
        • A “self-contained room” or “apartment” for individual content items. •
        Used for standalone content, like blog posts, news articles, or
        user-submitted content.
        Purpose: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could stand alone, 
        such as a blog post, news article, or user-submitted content. It usually includes
         its own title and is meant to be distributable or syndicateable.
        •	Usage: Use an <article> when the content is independently meaningful and could
           be published on its own, or when it makes sense to reference it outside of the 
           surrounding context.
        •	Example: Each blog post on a blog page can be wrapped in an <article>.
      </article>
      <aside>
        • The “sidebar” or “storage room” for secondary information. • Holds
        supplementary content related to the main content but not part of it,
        such as ads, additional links, or author bio information.
      </aside>
      <div>
        • The “generic room” or “flex space.” • A versatile container that is
        used to group other elements together, often for layout purposes or
        styling. It doesn't carry any semantic meaning by itself but helps with
        structure.
        Purpose: A generic container used for grouping elements without any semantic 
        meaning. It's primarily used for styling and layout purposes.
      •	Usage: Use a <div> when there is no suitable semantic element to represent the content.
        It's helpful for applying CSS styles or JavaScript functionality but does not provide 
        meaning to the content itself.
      •	Example: Wrapping multiple sections together for styling or organizational purposes.
      Use <div> for grouping visual components or layout elements that don't have specific semantic 
        meaning, much like organizing different parts of a drawing or design.

      </div>
      <form>
        • The “office” or “workroom” where users interact. • Used for input,
        such as user registrations, surveys, or logins.

        you typically use a <fieldset> instead of a <section> when you are grouping related form elements. The <fieldset> element is specifically designed for forms to group inputs, making it clear that they belong to a particular section of the form. It also allows you to optionally use a <legend> element to label the group.

          Here's a comparison:
          
          When to Use <fieldset>
          
            •	Group related form elements together (e.g., personal details, payment information).
            •	Provide a visual boundary around the group of form inputs.
            •	Use <legend> to give a label for the group.
        When to Use <section>

          •	<section> is used for grouping content that is thematically related on the page, but not specifically for forms.
          •	It organizes large sections of the page, not just form elements.
        

          •	<fieldset>: Specifically for forms, helps group related inputs with an optional label (<legend>).
            •	<section>: Used for broader page content, more general for organizing non-form content.
          
      </form>
      <figure>
        A “gallery room” used to group images, diagrams, and media.

      <section>
        The “decorations” within the rooms of your HTML structure are the
        smaller elements like text, images, and links that add content and
        visual detail. These elements don't define the overall layout but
        provide the actual content users interact with. Here's a breakdown:
        Common “Decorations” (Content Elements) in HTML Rooms: 1.
        <h1>Headings</h1>
        • Like “title signs” in different rooms. • Used to define headings or
        subheadings in content. The h1 tag is the most important (main heading),
        while h6 is the least important. 2.
        <p>
          Paragraphs • The “text” or “written notes” inside the room. • Used to
          structure blocks of text in a readable way.
        </p>
        3. <a>Links</a> • The “doorways” to other rooms or external places. •
        Used to create clickable links that direct users to other web pages,
        sections, or even external resources. 4. Images (<img />) • The
        “pictures” or “art on the walls.” • Used to embed images within the
        content. 5. Lists • The “bulletin boards” or “to-do lists” in the room.
        •
        <ul>
          <li>creates an unordered list (bulleted)</li>
          <li>is the list item element</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>creates an ordered list (numbered).</li>
          <li>is the list item element for both lists</li>
        </ol>
        6. <button>Buttons</button> • The “interactive switches” or
        “call-to-action” areas. • Used for clickable buttons that submit forms
        or perform other actions. 7. Input fields (<input />,
        <textarea>textareas</textarea>,
        <select>
          selections</select
        >) • The “form elements” or “user input devices.” • Allow users to enter
        data, such as text, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads, or dropdown
        options. 8. Bold and Italics • The “emphasis” or “highlighting” of
        certain parts. • <b>visual bold</b> and <i>italic styling</i>, while
        <strong>strong</strong> and <em>em</em> are used to emphasize importance
        semantically. 9.
        <blockquote>Blockquotes</blockquote>
        • The “framed quotes” on the walls. • Used to display quoted text, often
        from another source. 10. Line breaks (<br />) and Horizontal Rules (
        <hr />
        ) • The “dividers” or “spacers” in the room. • <br />
        is for line breaks (used in text to create single-line breaks), and
        <hr />
        is for horizontal lines to visually separate content.
      </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
      • The “basement” or the foundation of the page. • Appears at the bottom
      and typically contains copyright info, links to terms of service or
      privacy policies, and contact details. If your site involves communication
      with users, having a contact form or link in the footer (often common in
      web design) can improve user experience.
